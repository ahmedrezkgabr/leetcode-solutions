# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems on LeetCode. Each solution is organized by problem and includes the following files:
- `<solution>.cpp`: The C++ code file for the solution.
- `note.md` **(optional)**: A markdown file containing notes or explanations about the solution.
- `README.md`: A markdown file with the problem description.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
leetcode-solutions/
├── <1-problem>/
│   ├── <solution>.cpp
│   ├── note.md
│   ├── README.md
├── <2-problem>/
│   ├── <solution>.cpp
│   ├── note.md
│   ├── README.md
├── ...
└── README.md
```

## Problem Directories

Each problem has its own directory named `<n-problem>`, where `n` is the problem number or unique identifier from LeetCode. Inside each directory:
- `<solution>.cpp`: Contains the C++ implementation of the solution.
- `note.md`: Contains any notes, explanations, or thought processes behind the solution.
- `README.md`: Contains the description of the problem as provided on LeetCode.

## Using the Repository

1. **Cloning the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedrezkgabr/leetcode-solutions.git
   cd leetcode-solutions
   ```

2. **Navigating to a Problem Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd <1-problem>
   ```

3. **Viewing the Solution**:
   - Open `<solution>.cpp` to view the code.
   - Open `note.md` to read any notes or explanations.
   - Open `README.md` to see the problem description.

## Pushing Solutions

The pushing of solutions is automated through the LeetHub extension. LeetHub is a browser extension that allows you to automatically push your LeetCode submissions to your GitHub repository. This ensures that your solutions are regularly updated and backed up.
